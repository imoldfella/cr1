The Datagrove internship program hires students and pays their tuition for a Computer Science major at universities in San Jose, Costa Rica. 

Away from school you will help us build the next generation of software to support mercy and justice in the world. Datagrove's first product is still in stealth mode, but ask us and we'd be happy to share.

When in school we want your focus to be on learning everything you can, you will work 8-10 flexible hours per week. When your school is on break, come work with us 40 hours a week and write great software!

**Full Stack Intern** - $15/hour :dollar:, New Laptop :computer:, plus Tuition Reimbursement :mortar_board:

You will practice what you are learning in school building software for a better world. You will use Typescript, Go, Dart/Flutter, and Rust :crab:. Work on a team of interns where your input is welcome and needed. When you graduate, we hope you will stay!

You will also get practice with English, which for better or worse is the trade language of computer science. English is your most important computer language, and the one that requires the most practice :100:
